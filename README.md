Zopa loan calculator 

Run it 
./gradlew run -PappArgs="['/path/to/file.csv',  'amount']"  or just in an ide

Things i didnt manage to do :(

-Write unit tests for the main controller
-Come up with a smart way to group lenders - perhaps by the same interest rate such that they all get an even share of loaning money
-Get the loan amount and repayment correct.

Thanks for the task :)
